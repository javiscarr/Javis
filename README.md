## Hello there, I'm Javis 👋🏾

### About Me

I'm a 2012 graduate of Alabama A&M University where I majored in Industrial Technology. For the past 7 years, I have been a flight attendant with a major airline traveling the world and enjoying the experiences learned visting other countries and sightseeing. I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack web development program at Georgia Institute of Technology with the expectations of learning as much as I can when it comes to coding. It is my goal to gain as much experience and knowledge of the tools needed to excel and began fulfilling my dream of creating captivating and useful applications.
